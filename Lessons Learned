Lessons Learned:
Overall, this project had much more depth to it than what seemed on the surface. Firstly, We learned that  constant interaction between the developer and the customer is very important. When Working on this project on a week by week basis, if we had not asked questions and found out useful information concerning what the customer was looking for, we would not have been able to deliver a quality product. 
Secondly, we learned that making a CSV parser is not as simple as just getting all the data within a few functions. We actually need to organize the data into manageable chunks using some form of database that would allow the user access to even without necessarily having the software pre-installed. 
Thirdly, We learned about the necessity of Cross-Platform Independent Implementations. Most of our team used Windows/Linux operating systems so when we began developing our product, we didn't realize until very late in the project that we need to make sure our code could be easily transferable to a mac operating system. This offered its own set of issues concerning debugging and testing in which our team had to find an OS X system to use. 
Fourthly, We learned that though our team has varying strengths and weaknesses, we had to adapt and conform our group to the work at optimal efficiency within the given time constraints.
