Team Quality:

	Leadership:
				We did not have a direct leader for the entirety of the project. Each iteration had a member of the team become the leader. This was not directly stated but kind of became a component that each group member became accustomed to.

				Whoever was the "leader", was tasked with directing group focus for the iteration even  to go as far as assigning tasks to the other members.

	Planning: 
				In all honestly, we did not plan. We worked on a "this needs to be done" kind of basis. Planning probably would've been more beneficial, especially with the time constraints but we felt like we got the job done nevertheless.

	Individual contribution:

				Aldo Anaya: Initial Project Lead, developed tests and features in cucumber, Finalized the UI

				Nattapat White: Created the final GUI as well as developed functions that integrated with the database

				Darius Bell: Created the initial UI, Implemented the CSV into a relational Database, and wrote final documentation
