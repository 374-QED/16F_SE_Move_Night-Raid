Cucumber is a Behavior Driven Design (BDD) framework that takes "stories" or scenarios written in human readable languages such as English and turns those human readable text into a software test. It is very high level.

JUnit is a lower level "Unit test" tool that allows developers to test every possible code path in their code. It will test each module of your code (classes, or even methods).


Basically, Cucumber tests the overall features of what the the code should do and how it should work.

JUnit tests the code for any errors in the classes or methods.
